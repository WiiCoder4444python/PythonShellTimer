# PythonShellTimer
A Timer controlled via the Python Shell.

To make sure the timer runs with no errors, make sure you have the latest pygame installed, and a file named 'alarm.wav' (make sure its in 16-bit encoding, you change that via Audicity (File==>Export==>Export as Wav==>(select 16-bit encoding)==>Save)) in your ~/Downloads folder. Please report any bugs you find on the latest versoin and I will happly try to fix them. Happy Timing! -WiiCoder4444Python (aka.Ted). P.S: If you're having trouble, try running sudo apt install libsdl2-mixer-2.0-0, as some OSs don't include pygame default mixer drivers by default.
